## Professional research interests

I'm a PhD student in psychology [at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm](https://ki.se/en/people/vilgot-huhn). My research concerns Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as guided self-help online (ICBT) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I'm specifically focused on whether the mechanisms of change implied by our cognitive models of worry is actually at work within (I)CBT treatments. Other than that I have an interest in methods and meta-science and organize the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club at KI.

## Less professional research interests

I've been generally interested in psychology since I was a teenager. Some areas I'm especially nerdy about are:

-   Cognitive biases in decision making and belief formation.
-   Motivated cognition.
-   What are beliefs even?
-   The neuroscience of emotion.
-   Psychiatric diagnostic reasoning and nosology.

## Abjectly uprofessional interests

Dungeons and Dragons. *Kino.* Going on a trek in the Swedish mountains. Graphic novels. Radiohead.
