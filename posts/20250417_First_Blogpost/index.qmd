Some questions I have about these posts. Do they inherit theme from `_quatro.yml`? Do they re-render automatically if there's a change in them, i.e. if there's a html file already with the same name?

Do LaTeX work on the site? Let's try it. Works poorly since double slash doesn't make new lines so you have to `\begin{aligned}` and then `\end{aligned}`

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i \sim Normal(\mu,\sigma) \\
\mu \sim Normal(180,12) \\
\sigma \sim Exponential(1)
\end{aligned}
$$
