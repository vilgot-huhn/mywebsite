Do they re-render automatically if there’s a change in them, i.e. if there’s a html file already with the same name?\nDo LaTeX work on the site? Let’s try it. Works poorly since double slash doesn’t make new lines so you have to \\begin{aligned} and then \\end{aligned}\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i \\sim Normal(\\mu,\\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu \\sim Normal(180,12) \\\\\n\\sigma \\sim Exponential(1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"
