title: "personal substack"

I write my personal blog at Substack. It's called [unconfusion](https://unconfusion.substack.com/) and so far mostly concerns online discourse. I find some posts age quickly, but I stood by them when I wrote them and I can never change that. I'll cross-post some statistics or psychology related under "R/stats posts".
